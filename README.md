Hello 🟢 My name is Anubhav Tripathi. I specialize in **🟢Open Source Contribution** and am currently diving into **🟢Navigating GitHub like a Pro** (or at least trying to). I'm enthusiastic about solving the mystery of **🟢"Where did that PR go?"** and seeking guidance in **🟢Finding the perfect issue to fix** (if it even exists). Ask me about **🟢Git blame (because it's always my fault)**, **🟢Forks and Clones (and getting lost between them)**, **🟢Hunting Bugs (that I probably introduced)**, **🟢Writing Commit Messages (with just the right amount of panic)**, and **🟢Opening PRs that won't get ignored (fingers crossed)**.

You can reach out to me at 🟢[er.tripathianubhav@gmail.com](mailto:er.tripathianubhav@gmail.com).
